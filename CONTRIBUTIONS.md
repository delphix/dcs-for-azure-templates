# Contribution
Contributions are welcome! We follow a strict code quality and formatting guideline to keep the repository clean and maintainable.

If you'd like to contribute be sure you're starting with the latest templates (should they exist) before you make
changes. Once you're ready to contribute your changes back, the best way to get the templates ready to add to this repo
is by leveraging the `Export template` option from the tab of the pipeline detail view in Data Factory Studio.
(Tip: before exporting your template make sure variables are set to common-sense default values.)

To make this easier to follow, let's use an example. Suppose you'd like to add `sample_template_pl` to the set of
pipelines that are available in this repository. Your exported template will come from Azure with the name
`sample_template_pl.zip`. Once you unzip this file, it will produce a directory with structure like:
```
sample_template_pl
├── manifest.json
└── sample_template_pl.json
```

These files, since they are meant to be imported directly into Data Factory Studio are not well-suited to version
control (as they are one very long line). To make these files more suited to version control, the following utility
script has been provided [./scripts/format.sh](./scripts/format.sh). To leverage the script, export the template from
the data factory studio, this will result in a zip file downloaded to your local machine, move the template from the
download destination directory to the base directory of the repository, from a terminal with a working directory
of this repository, run `./scripts/format.sh`.

Using the example above, the script will unzip the template, re-format the files leveraging `jq` and then remove the
zip file. Note that this will only unzip the pipelines that we already have support for in this repo. Manual unzip will
need to be performed for new pipelines.

New templates will need to have an associated `README.md` and for them to be built into the `releases` folder, edits
will have to be made to the `docker-compose.yaml`. For this example, you'd have to add a line
`zip sample_template_pl.zip sample_template_pl/* &&` somewhere between `apt-get install -y zip &&`
and `mv *.zip releases/."`.

If Metadata store scripts are needed to support your new templates or new features, please update the
`metadata_store_scripts` directory to include those changes, and update the `README.md` for all impacted templates to
incidate the need for the new DB version. New statements should play nicely with previous statements - isolate the
changes in a particular versioned script, and follow the version naming convention. Versioned scripts follow the naming
convention `V<version_number>__<comment>.sql`, where `<version_number>` is `YYYY.MM.DD.#` and represents the date when
this script is added (with the final digit being used to allow multiple versions to be tagged with the same date).
You can leverage the [./scripts/migrations.sh](./scripts/migrations.sh) to automatically add the new versioned migration
to the [./metadata_store_scripts/bootstrap.sql](./metadata_store_scripts/bootstrap.sql) file.


## Code Style and Standards
Before committing, you must run the `pre-commit` checks to ensure your changes meet the repository’s standards.

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use `pre-commit` to enforce coding standards like:

1. Directory names containing ADF pipeline templates for different source and sink databases.
2. Naming convention of source and sink databases in the ADF pipeline templates formatting.
3. Parameter and dataflow naming convention in pipeline templates.
4. Version numbering.
5. Validation of `CHANGELOG.md`.
6. `YAML`/`SQL`/`JSON` validation.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1: Install pre-commit
If you don’t have it already, install pre-commit:
```
pip install pre-commit
```
#### 2: Run checks manually (optional)
Before committing, you can run the pre-commit hooks manually:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
This is helpful to catch issues early before writing your commit message.

### Commit Message Guidelines
Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for all commit messages to ensure consistency and automation support. Examples:
```
chore: any non code related change
feat: adding new templates or a feature in an existing template
docs: documentation update
```
