# dcs-for-azure-templates
A collection of templates that can be used to leverage Delphix Compliance Services in Azure.

## Setup
To use Delphix Compliance Services for Azure, and specifically to leverage these pipelines you will need to have the
following linked services in your data factory:
* REST service for talking to DCS for Azure
* Azure SQL Database for storing metadata about the data you wish to profile and mask

### To Import Latest Version Templates

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up && stty sane`, this will create the latest version of all templates
and put them in the `releases` directory. The `stty sane` is to fix the terminal as docker-compose doesn't always
clean up after itself correctly. From there, you can import the template into your data factory using the Data
Factory Studio:
* From the `Author` tab, click the `+` next to the search bar for the Factory Resources
* Select `Pipeline`, then `Import from pipeline template`
  * This will open a file explorer window, you can select the recently built template
  from the `releases` folder. 
* After selecting the appropriate template, you will be asked to to select the linked
services for various steps in the pipeline.
* Each template will be different, please refer to the `README.md` file
in the template's folder to familiarize yourself with the linked services that should be selected.


### Self-Hosted Metadata Store

This metadata store will consist of a few tables, a series of scripts for defining the tables required by the metadata
store has been provided under the [metadata_store_scripts](./metadata_store_scripts) directory.

Database versions are determined by date. If you're just getting started, we've combined all required SQL commands
into [metadata_store_scripts/bootstrap.sql](./metadata_store_scripts/bootstrap.sql). If you've already got a version of
the metadata store, you may need to apply migrations for subsequent versions in order to update the metadata store to
the required version in order for a new version of the templates to work - each template will contain a README that will
indicate what the minimum required version of the metadata store is required. We aim to make it so that all migrations
will not break existing pipelines.

The migration scripts do not specify a schema, as you are free to create these scripts in independent schemas per your
needs. However, this means before running the script, you will need to specify the schema you are working in (unless you
choose to leverage the default `dbo` schema).

The metadata store consists of the following tables that all must be in the same schema:
* `discovered_ruleset` - This table is used to define a ruleset. The ruleset uniquely identifies columns and the
algorithms that should be applied to those columns. This table is populated in one of two ways:
    1. Automatically, via the profiling pipeline. The data in this table is populated in two stages.
       1. Probe the information schema or other metadata about the specified database, schema, catalog, etc. Populate
       the `discovered_ruleset` table with as much of the following information as possible:
          * `dataset` (static) - determines which type of data this is, it will be something like `SNOWFLAKE`, but
             will be representative of the datasource; this value and will be statically populated in the appropriate
             profiling pipeline, and will be checked in masking pipelines to make sure that rules are applied only when
             they are referring to the appropriate dataset
          * `specified_database` (parameter) - the top-level identifier for the dataset, in the case of things
             like AzureSQL and Snowflake this will be the `database`, for things like Databricks it will mean the
             `catalog`
          * `speficied_schema` (parameter) - the second-level identifier for the dataset, in the case of things
             like AzureSQL, Snowflake, and Databricks this will be the `schema`, but may vary in the future for other
             data sources that have an analogous concept, but with a different name
          * `identified_table` (determined) - the third-level identifier for the dataset, in the case of things
             like AzureSQL, Snowflake, and Databricks this will be the `table`, but may vary in the future for other
             data sources that have an analogous concept, but with a different name
          * `identified_column` (determined) - the fourth-level identifier for the dataset, in the case of things
             like AzureSQL, Snowflake, and Databricks this will be the `column`, but may vary in the future for other
             data sources that have an analogous concept, but with a different name
          * `identified_column_type` (determined) - either the exact data type provided by the information schema or
             a slightly modified version of what's provided by the information schema, this modification is used in
             order for it to be more easily joined with the `adf_type_mapping` table
          * `ordinal_position` (determined) - the ordinal position of the column in the table, which refers to the
             column's location when ordering within a table
          * `row_count` (determined) - the number of rows in the table, if this is available in metadata then it is
             populated in this stage, if it is not, then it is added in the next stage
          * `metadata` (determined) - additional JSON-structured metadata whose specific structure will vary based on
             the dataset and in some cases may not be required
            * When a custom date format is required for an algorithm (besides `yyyy-MM-dd` or
              `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'` which are the default), the key `date_format` must be specified in the
              metadata
              * As an example, if you have a column `transaction_date` in your `Snowflake` instance, and each time that
                column appears it has a date formated as `yyyyMMdd`, you should specify this format using an update
                statement like
                ```sql
                UPDATE discovered_ruleset
                SET metadata = JSON_MODIFY(coalesce(metadata,'{}'), '$.date_format', 'yyyyMMdd')
                WHERE dataset = 'SNOWFLAKE' AND identified_column = 'transaction_date';
                ```
                Setting this value incorrectly will cause non-conformant data errors when the data violates the
                specified pattern. The important thing here is that the JSON value in the `metadata` column contains a
                `date_format` key at the root, and that the value of that key is the string that represents the format.
       2. Collect data from the specified table and column combination and perform data profiling to determine if the
          data is likely to be sensitive. This is done by calling the `profiling` endpoint in DCS for Azure services,
          collecting the results of profiling, and persisting them to the `discovered_ruleset` metadata table,
          populating for key `(dataset, specified_database, specified_schema, identified_table, identified_column)`, the
          following values:
          * `row_count` (determined) - the number of rows in the table, if this was not populated by the previous phase,
             it is populated in this phase using a `SELECT COUNT(1)` type operation
          * `profiled_domain` (determined) - the domain of the data that resulted when profiling determined the
             existence of sensitive data
          * `profiled_algorithm` (determined) - the algorithm that could be applied to this data for masking as
             determined by profiling for the existence of sensitive data
          * `confidence_score` (determined) - the confidence score as it applies to the profiling result, represented as
             a value from `[0.00000, 1.0000]` that represents how closely the profiled data matches the sensitive data
             classifiers for the profiled domain and algorithm pair
          * `rows_profiled` - the number of rows included in the profiling request
    2. Manually, where users enter values to create rows for fields in each of the tables to define which rules (masking
algorithms) should be applied when masking data. This is not preferred as it is error-prone.
* `adf_data_mapping` - This table is used to define source to destination mappings for the masking pipeline. The table
   maps a source `dataset, database, schema, table` to a corresponding destination `dataset, database, schema, table`.
   The rules in the ruleset (defined in `discovered_ruleset`) will be applied when performing masking and will copy data
   (either masked or unmasked, depending on how the ruleset is configured) from the source to the sink.
* `adf_type_mapping` - This table is used to track how data should be treated as it flows through masking pipeline in
   Azure Data Factory, where applicable. The values in this table are inserted in the migration scripts.

## Building A Ruleset

For data to be masked, there must be a mapping in the `adf_data_mapping` table, and at least one `assigned_algorithm`
assigned to the table. Note that the `profiled_algorithm` that is populated as a result of the profiling pipeline should
always produce a valid algorithm name.

### Conditional Masking

To apply different algorithms based on data assigned to a key column, it is important to set the `assigned_algorithm`
correctly for the masking pipeline to work.

#### Defining the Key Conditions

The key column is the column whose value must be evaluated to determine which algorithm to apply. The assigned algorithm
of a key column is to be a JSON array consisting of JSON objects that contain "alias" and "condition" keys. As such the
key column itself cannot be masked.

The `alias` key defines the alias for the filter condition, this will be used when defining conditional algorithms. All
conditions should be mutually exclusive, otherwise you can end up with the same input rows being masked with different
algorithms. The conditions must be compatible with ADF expression language.
Note that `default` can be used as an alias and should not have any associated conditions, this is because
the query to determine the conditions will automatically build the conditions for the default condition by combining
with a logical and the negation of all other conditions. Also note that we support a shortcut for referencing the value
in the key column (`%` by default), so that more complex filter conditions can be built.

Consider a key column with values `KEY_1`, `KEY_2`, `KEY_3`, `KEY_4`, `KEY_5`, and `KEY_6`. Consider a few different
key aliases that help us identify `KEY_1`, `KEY_2`, `KEY_3`, and set a default behavior for everything else as well.

We can construct the value of `assigned_algorithm` using a structure like the following:
```
[
    {
        "alias": "K1",
        "condition":"% == 'KEY_1'"
    },
    {
        "alias": "K2",
        "condition":"endsWith(%, '2')"
    },
    {
        "alias": "K3",
        "condition":"startsWith(%, 'KEY_3')"
    },
    {
        "alias": "default"
    }
]
```

What this means is that the table will need to me masked in 4 stages (one for each condition), `K1` will mask all rows
where the value in the key column is exactly equal to `KEY_1`, `K2` will mask all rows where the value in the key column
ends with `2`, `K3` will mask all rows where the value in the key column starts with `KEY_3`, and `default` will mask
all rows that are not equal to `KEY_1` and that don't end with `2` and that don't start with `KEY_3`.

Note that the alias names must be unique per table. Further,there can be only one key column defined in each table.
Should you need to use multiple key columns in the same table, this is only supported by referring to the additional key
columns in the conditions of the primary key column. Let's suppose we want to add a secondary key column,
`secondary_row_type`. To do this, in the definitions of the conditions for `row_type` (our primary key column), we would
need to refer to the value of the secondary key column, which can be done by using `byName('secondary_row_type')`
instead of `%`. It is important to consider that conditions must still be mutually exclusive, and so if possible
try to avoid the need for multiple key columns in the same table as the number of conditions and the logic for defining
them is more complicated.

#### Defining the Conditional Algorithms

Conditional algorithms are defined by specifying the key colum, using the key column's aliases and assigning an
algorithm names in those conditions.

Considering the example above that describes how to specify the key column's aliases, let's suppose that column's name
is `row_type`, we can conditionally define the algorithms to the conditions based on their aliases as follows:

```json
{
    "key_column":"row_type",
    "conditions": [
        {
            "alias":"K1",
            "algorithm":"dlpx-core: Phone US"
        },
        {
            "alias":"K2",
            "algorithm":"dlpx-core: Email SL"
        },
        {
            "alias":"K3",
            "algorithm":"dlpx-core: CM Digits"
        },
        {
            "alias":"default",
            "algorithm":"dlpx-core: CM Alpha-Numeric"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that we're specifying the key column and referring to the column by name, we're specifying the conditions in which
we will apply masking, which are referred to by the alias defined in the key column, and we specify the algorithms to
apply to each of the conditions separately.

#### Defining a Conditional Date Format

Conditional date formats are defined by specifying the key column, using the key column's aliases and assign a date
format in those conditions in the `metadata` column.

Considering the example above that describes how to specify the key column's aliases, let's suppose that column's name
is `row_type`, we can conditionally define the date format to the conditions based on their aliases as follows:

```json
{
  "key_column":"row_type",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "alias":"K1",
      "date_format":"yyyyMMdd"
    },
    {
      "alias":"K2",
      "date_format":"yyyy-MM-dd"
    },
    {
      "alias":"K3",
      "date_format":"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm"
    },
    {
      "alias":"default",
      "date_format":"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this requires that the `assigned_algorithm` for the `row_type` column in this table to define the conditions
and their aliases. Further note that this means you should not specify `date_format` at the top-level of the `metadata`
when there is a conditional date format.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome!

If you'd like to contribute be sure you're starting with the latest templates (should they exist) before you make
changes. Once you're ready to contribute your changes back, the best way to get the templates ready to add to this repo
is by leveraging the `Export template` option from the tab of the pipeline detail view in Data Factory Studio.
(Tip: before exporting your template make sure variables are set to common-sense default values.)

To make this easier to follow, let's use an example. Suppose you'd like to add `sample_template_pl` to the set of
pipelines that are available in this repository. Your exported template will come from Azure with the name
`sample_template_pl.zip`. Once you unzip this file, it will produce a directory with structure like:
```
sample_template_pl
├── manifest.json
└── sample_template_pl.json
```

These files, since they are meant to be imported directly into Data Factory Studio are not well-suited to version
control (as they are one very long line). To make these files more suited to version control, the following utility
script has been provided [./scripts/format.sh](./scripts/format.sh). To leverage the script, export the template from
the data factory studio, this will result in a zip file downloaded to your local machine. To leverage the script, move
the template from your Downloads directory to the base directory of the repo. From there run (from a terminal)
`./scripts/format.sh`.

Using the example above, the script will unzip the template, re-format the files leveraging `jq` and then remove the
zip file. Note that this will only unzip the pipelines that we already have support for in this repo. Manual unzip will
need to be performed for new pipelines.

New templates will need to have an associated `README.md` and for them to be built into the `releases` folder, edits
will have to be made to the `docker-compose.yaml`. For this example, you'd have to add a line
`zip sample_template_pl.zip sample_template_pl/* &&` somewhere between `apt-get install -y zip &&`
and `mv *.zip releases/."`.

If Metadata store scripts are needed to support your new templates or new features, please update the `metadata_store_scripts`
directory to include those changes. New statements should play nicely with previous statements - isolate the changes in
a particular versioned script, and follow the version naming convention, as well as adding them to the end of
`bootstrap.sql` (please also edit the comment at the top of `bootstrap.sql` to indicate which version scripts have been
added). Versioned scripts follow the naming convention `V<version_number>__<comment>.sql`, where `<version_number>` is
`YYYY.MM.DD.#` and represents the date when this script is added (with the final digit being used to allow multiple
versions to be tagged with the same date).
